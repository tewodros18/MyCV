                <p class="title">Pixels Vs Relative units in CSS styling, Does it matter?</p>
                    <article>
                        <p class="o"> 
                            Yes! The most important reason for using responsive and relative values in our CSS is for supporting users that rely on scaling the content 
                            for reasons including various visual inablities including myopia ,dyslxia. Users need to be able to zoom the viewport without loss of content or functionality, or restrictions imposed by CSS values or viewport scaling settings.
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>must be able to resize text without assistive technology up to 200 percent, without loss of content or functionality.</p> </li>
                                <li><p>must be able to resize text without being forced to scroll both horizontally and vertically to read that content.</p> </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The main counter argument that can be posed for using fixed values like pixels instead of relative values like rem or em is the continuous improvment
                            in the ablitiy of browsers to provide Zoom functionality. Since most popular browsers offer the option to zoom a given webpage why should
                            web developers go the extra mile to calculate and change pixels into relative values? Well as long as the browser's
                            size is set to the default value often 16px the Zoom function is adquate to navigate but The problem arises when the WebPage
                            is visted by a user using a browser with a different default font size.
                            If a user changes the default settings in a browser, ideally all the fonts will scale up (or down) proportionately in reference to the size of the font selected in the setting. Ideally, that is, if the webpage is using relative CSS units.
                             This browser font size adjustment won’t have any effect on typography that uses fixed value like pixels for font-size and/or the line-height.
                             this failure to scale up proportionally will often cause static fonts and compressed line spacing, and such line spacing can be tough to parse for users who have a cognitive disability
                             
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, This will force the user to continuously zoom in and out as they navigate from one sectioni of the website to the other 
                            breaking the seamless interaction that can be easily acheived by using the relative values.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In conclusion, when designing a website developers should consider the fact that
                            users do change their default font settings, and the developer should be maintaining users’ control over their own browsing experience.
                            If relative CSS units are used for the typography of the website
                            it maintains the fidelity of the WebPage's layouts without negatively impacting the needs of users.

                <p class="title">"16px", how does a browser's default width and fixed values work</p>
                    <article>
                        <p class="o">
                            Absolute length units such as pixels are fixed in relation to each other.
                            <ul id="j">
                                <li>in: inches — 1in is equal to 2.54cm.</li>
                                <li>pt: points — the points used by CSS are equal to 1/72nd of 1in.</li>
                                <li>px: pixel units — 1px is equal to 0.75pt.</li>
                            </ul> 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For a CSS device, these dimensions are either anchored (i) by relating the physical units to their physical measurements, or (ii) by relating the pixel unit to the reference pixel. For print media and similar high-resolution devices, the anchor unit should be one of the standard physical units (inches, centimeters, etc). For lower-resolution devices, and devices with unusual viewing distances, it is recommended instead that the anchor unit be the pixel unit.
                             For such devices it is recommended that the pixel unit refer to the whole number of device pixels that best approximates the reference pixel.
                             The reference pixel is the visual angle of one pixel on a device with a pixel density of 96dpi and a distance from the reader of an arm's length. For a nominal arm's length of 28 inches, the visual angle is therefore about 0.0213 degrees.
                            For reading at arm's length, 1px thus corresponds to about 0.26 mm (1/96 inch).
                              
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So after understanding What 1px represents next thing is what happens when a browser renders an HTML file i.e a webpage its going to display it in the default browser 
                            font size which is 16px so any scaling to be done such as using 200px will be done proportionally taking the 16px or 1rem as a base line.
                        </p>

                <p class="title">What's new in CSS3</p>
                    <article>
                        <p>
                            <h1>CSS3 selectors</h1> Addition to the selectors that were available in CSS2, CSS 3 introduces some new selectors. Using these selectors you can choose DOM elements based on their attributes.
                            <ul id="j">
                                <li>[attr^=val] Â- matches a DOM element with the attribute attr and a value starting with val</li>
                                <li>[attr$=val] Â- matches a DOM element with the attribute attr and a value ending with the suffix val</li>
                                <li>[attr*=val] Â- matches a DOM element with the attribute attr and a value containing the substring val</li>
                            </ul> 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h1>Rounded corner</h1>previously before CSS3 making edges round required lots of code and trial and error to get it to the appropriate 
                            degree. but CSS3 introduced the Border Radius attribute which takes values the rounds the corners by that amount.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h1>CSS3 Colors</h1>
                            CSS3 brings with it support for some new ways of describing colours .
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prior to CSS3, we declared colours using the hexadecimal format (#FFF, or #FFFFFF for white).
                            The color keyword list has been extended in the CSS3 color module to include 147 additional keyword colors, 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            CSS3 also provides a number of other options: HSL, HSLA, and RGBA.
                            The most notable change with these new color types is the ability to declare semitransparent colors.
                            RGBA works just like RGB, except that it adds a fourth value: alpha, the opacity level or alpha transparency level. The first three values still represent red, green, and blue.
                             For the alpha value, 1 means fully opaque, 0 is fully transparent, and 0.5 is 50% opaque. 
                            <h1>Drop Shadows</h1>CSS3 provides the ability to add drop shadows to elements using the box-shadow property.
                            lets you specify the color, height, width, blur, and offset of one or multiple inner and/or outer drop shadows on your elements.
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            box-shadow Eg: 2px 5px 0 0 rgba(72,72,72,1); 
                            <h1>Linear Gradients</h1>CSS3 added the syntax for generating linear gradients with CSS3.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>
                            <br>
                        </p>
